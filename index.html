      <p class="header-text text"> <span>Vikings</span> is a historical drama television series created and written by Michael Hirst for the History channel, a Canadian network. Filmed in Ireland, it premiered on March 3, 2013, in Canada. The series concluded on December 30, 2020, when the second half of the sixth season was released in its entirety on Amazon Prime Video in Ireland, ahead of its broadcast on History in Canada from January 1 to March 3, 2021. A sequel series, titled <span>Vikings</span>: Valhalla, is set to premiere on February 25, 2022 on Netflix.</p>
      <p class="header-text text"><span>Vikings</span> is inspired by the sagas of Ragnar Lothbrok, a <span>Viking</span> who is one of the best-known legendary Norse heroes and notorious as the scourge of Anglo-Saxon England and West Francia. The show portrays Ragnar as a farmer who rises to fame by raiding England and eventually becomes a Scandinavian king, with the support of his family and fellow warriors. In the later seasons, the series follows the fortunes of his sons and their adventures in England, Scandinavia, Kievan Rus', the Mediterranean and North America.</p>

    <h3 class="title">The plot of the series</h3>
    <br>
    <p class="header-text text">The series is not strictly historical and freely interprets the Scandinavian sagas about the <span>Viking</span> raids on Anglo-Saxon Britain, the West Frankish kingdom and other lands. The laxity of the <span>"Vikings"</span> is noticeable by the discrepancy between many dates and the combination of individuals who lived in different time periods. The key character of the plot is the semi-legendary Scandinavian king Ragnar Lodbrok, who allegedly descended from the god Odin. In addition to Ragnar, the protagonists are also his sons, friends, wives Lagert and Aslaug and other historical figures, for example, the Norwegian king Harald the Fair-Haired or the King of Wessex Alfred the Great. The action begins with the drama of one <span>Viking</span> and gradually gains momentum, turning into an epic story about the wars of the kingdoms. The series also has a mystical component: seer characters, spiritual connection between loved ones, ghosts, and even incarnations of the gods.</p>

The antecedents of the Knights Templar: these are people who were absolutely religious, yet they put on armor and they fought. Don't let their priestly status fool you, either. 'They were crazy!
